### A Hook-powered Limit Order Example on Uniswap V4

This project demonstrates how to build a **Limit Order Hook** using the **Uniswap V4 architecture** â€” showcasing the power of hooks, flash accounting, and the singleton design.
Built entirely in **Solidity** with **Foundry**, this contract acts as an on-chain extension of Uniswap V4, enabling users to create and execute limit orders directly through the **Hook system**.
